/*
  styles.css (compiled) has been deprecated.
  All rules now live in the SCSS partials under `styles/` and the canonical entrypoint is
  `styles/main.scss`. During development the SASS is compiled and injected by the build
  pipeline. This file is intentionally kept minimal to avoid duplicate rules.

  If you need to see the full compiled output, build the project (pnpm build) and inspect
  the generated CSS in the dist/ folder.

/* NOTE: This file intentionally contains no runtime styles. See styles/main.scss and
   the `styles/components/` partials for the canonical source of truth. */
