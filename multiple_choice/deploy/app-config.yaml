# Deployment configuration for assessment app (example)
# This file can be used by your deployment tooling to set a default language.
# Note: runtime hostname subdomain detection still takes precedence so a single
# deployment can serve multiple languages by using subdomains like
# javascript.example.com, php.example.com, etc.

defaultLanguage: javascript
