        },
        "correct": "C",
        "explanation": "Microtasks (Promise callbacks, mutation observer callbacks) are executed after the currently running script and before the event loop continues to the next macrotask; they are drained before rendering/paint.",

        "correct": "A",
        "explanation": "fetch() returns a Promise and integrates better with modern APIs (streams, Service Workers), whereas XHR uses callbacks and an older API surface.",

        "correct": "B",

        "correct": "B",
        "explanation": "Chunking heavy work across requestAnimationFrame frames or using setTimeout (or cooperative yielding) keeps the UI responsive; creating many workers is heavy and while loops block the thread.",

        "correct": "B",
        "explanation": "setTimeout schedules a macrotask; macrotasks run after the current script and microtasks are drained, so the timeout callback runs later than Promise microtasks.",
