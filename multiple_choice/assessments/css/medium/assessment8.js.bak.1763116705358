            explanation: "Mobile-first means starting with base styles for small screens, then using <pre>min-width</pre> media queries to add or override styles as screen size increases. This approach is generally more efficient and aligns with progressive enhancement. Example: base mobile CSS, then <pre>@media (min-width: 768px)</pre>.",

            explanation: "Desktop-first starts with styles for large screens, then uses <pre>max-width</pre> media queries to override or adapt styles for progressively smaller screens. While less common now, it was the traditional approach before mobile browsing became dominant.",

            },
            correct: "B",
            explanation: "Mobile-first encourages starting simple (mobile constraints force focus on essential content) and progressively adding complexity for larger screens. It often results in better performance on mobile devices since they don't download styles they'll override, and aligns with the reality that mobile traffic often exceeds desktop.",

                D: "Only 768px"
            },
            correct: "B",
            explanation: "Common breakpoints roughly correspond to device categories: ~320px (small phones), ~480px (phones landscape), ~768px (tablets portrait), ~1024px (tablets landscape/small laptops), ~1200px+ (desktops). However, modern best practice is to add breakpoints based on content needs rather than specific devices.",

            id: 11,

            },
            correct: "B",
            explanation: "Modern responsive design recommends adding breakpoints where your content needs them, not targeting specific devices. Device sizes are constantly changing, so designing for content flexibility creates more resilient layouts. Test at various sizes and add breakpoints where layout or readability suffers.",

            },
            correct: "B",
            explanation: "Use <pre>and</pre> to require all conditions: <pre>@media screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px)</pre>. Use commas for OR logic (either condition matches): <pre>@media (min-width: 768px), print</pre>. You can also use <pre>not</pre> and <pre>only</pre> keywords.",

            },
            correct: "B",
            explanation: "The <pre>orientation: portrait</pre> media feature matches when the viewport height is greater than or equal to its width (taller than wide). <pre>orientation: landscape</pre> matches when width exceeds height.

            explanation: "You can apply media queries to <pre><link></pre> elements using the <pre>media</pre> attribute. However, note that browsers download all stylesheets regardless of media queries; the media attribute only determines when they're applied.

            explanation: "<pre>hover: hover</pre> detects if the primary input device supports hovering (typically mouse or trackpad). Touch-only devices would match <pre>hover: none</pre>.

            explanation: "Mobile-first often results in less CSS because you start with a simpler base (mobile constraints naturally reduce complexity) and progressively add features.
