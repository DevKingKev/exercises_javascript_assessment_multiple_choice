      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "fr units distribute the remaining available space after accounting for gaps, fixed-size tracks, and content. Percentages are based on the total container size and don't account for gaps, which can cause overflow. fr units are more flexible and gap-aware.",

      "explanation": "This creates a responsive grid that automatically fits as many columns as possible, with each column at least 200px wide but able to grow. auto-fit creates only as many tracks as needed for content, collapsing empty tracks. This is a powerful responsive pattern.",
