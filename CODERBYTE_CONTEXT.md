## Application 2: Vite + TypeScript Multiple Choice Platform (multiple_choice)

### Description
A unified assessment platform built with **Vite and TypeScript** that dynamically loads different multiple choice tests from modular resource files. This consolidates all multiple choice functionality into a single scalable application with comprehensive type safety, modern build tooling, hot module replacement (HMR), and an optimized development workflow. Tests are stored as data files rather than separate applications.

### Key Features
- **Modern Build System**: Vite for fast HMR and optimized production builds
- **Development Proxy Architecture**: Express server proxies to Vite in dev mode for seamless development
- **Dynamic test loading** from modular resource files
- **Question grid navigation** with visual progress indicators for jumping to specific questions
- **Test selection interface** with difficulty levels and topic descriptions
- **API-driven architecture** for loading test metadata and content
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile
- **Unified timer system** with visual warnings
- **Comprehensive results** with detailed explanations and topic breakdown
- **Scalable structure** for easy addition of new tests
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Instant updates during development without full page reloads

### Architecture Overview

#### Development Mode
```
npm run dev
  ↓
dev-runner.js orchestrates:
  1. tsc --watch (server: tsconfig.server.json → dist/server.js)
  2. vite dev server (client: port 5173 with HMR)
  3. node dist/server.js (Express on port 3001)
     ↓
Express proxies non-/api requests → Vite (port 5173)
API routes handled by Express directly
Browser accesses: http://localhost:3001
```

#### Production Build
```
npm run build
  ↓
1. tsc -p tsconfig.server.json → dist/server.js (CommonJS)
2. vite build → dist/public/ (optimized client bundle)
  ↓
npm start
  ↓
Express serves static files from dist/public/
Browser accesses: http://localhost:3001
```

### Technical Implementation
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.x for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript on port 3001
- **Client**: TypeScript (ES2020 modules) compiled via Vite
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server on port 5173 (proxied through Express)
- **Dev Orchestration**: Custom script (`scripts/dev-runner.js`) manages:
  - TypeScript watch compilation for server
  - Vite dev server with HMR
  - Express server with dynamic proxy
  - Automatic restarts on server code changes
- **Proxy Middleware**: `http-proxy-middleware` for dev mode routing
- **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive interfaces for all data structures
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/tests` - List all available tests by difficulty
  - `GET /api/test/:difficulty/:testId` - Load specific test data
- **Test Format**: Node.js modules exporting typed metadata and questions
- **Dynamic Loading**: Type-safe tests loaded on-demand via fetch API calls
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to add new tests without code changes

### Development Workflow Improvements
- **Fast HMR**: Vite provides instant hot module replacement for client code
- **Automatic Restarts**: Server restarts automatically when TypeScript server code changes
- **Single Command**: `npm run dev` starts everything with one command
- **Port Management**: Browser URL stays on port 3001; Vite runs internally on 5173
- **No MIME Errors**: Proper proxying ensures correct content types for all resources
- **Polling-based File Watching**: Avoids system file watcher limits (EMFILE errors)

   - multiple_choice: 3001 (consolidated platform)
   - easy_1: 3002
   - Future apps: Increment by 1 (3003, 3004, etc.)

2. **Folder Naming Convention**:
   - `{difficulty}_{format}_{number}`
   - Examples: easy_1, medium_coding_1, hard_multiple_choice_2

3. **npm Scripts Standard**:
   - `npm run dev` - Start development server
   - `npm start` - Alternative start command
   - Auto-browser opening on server start

4. **Question Format Standards**:
   - **Coding**: Include test cases, solutions, and explanations
   - **Multiple Choice**: 4 options (A, B, C, D), correct answer, and detailed explanations

5. **Assessment Timing**:
   - Standard: 30 minutes
   - May vary based on difficulty and question count

## File Structure Standards

Each assessment application should include:
- `package.json` - npm configuration
- `server.js` - Express development server
- `index.html` - Main application interface
- `styles.css` - Complete styling and responsive design
- `questions.js` - Question bank with appropriate format
- `app.js` - Assessment logic and functionality
- `README.md` - Documentation and usage instructions
- `.gitignore` - Standard Node.js exclusions

## Context Preservation Notes

This context file should be updated whenever:
1. New assessment applications are created
2. Significant features are added or modified
3. The folder structure changes
4. New question types or formats are introduced
5. Technical architecture changes are made

## Current Status

As of October 24, 2025:

- ✅ easy_1 (coding assessment) - Complete and tested (JavaScript)
- ✅ multiple_choice (Vite + TypeScript platform) - **MIGRATED TO VITE** with HMR and modern build tooling
  - Complete with 4 test modules and question grid navigation
  - Vite dev server with instant hot module replacement
  - Express proxy architecture for seamless development
  - Dual build system (client: Vite bundle, server: CommonJS)
  - Type-safe interfaces for all data structures
  - Custom dev orchestration with automatic restarts
  - Production-ready with optimized builds
- ❌ easy_multiple_choice_1, easy_multiple_choice_2, easy_multiple_choice_3 - Removed (replaced by consolidated Vite+TypeScript platform)
- 🔄 Ready for additional assessment development
- 📦 Both remaining applications have dependencies installed and are functional

## User Intentions

The user plans to:
1. Continue building more assessment applications
2. Create a comprehensive suite of programming interview preparation tools
3. Maintain consistency across all assessment applications

## TypeScript Migration Benefits (multiple_choice)

The TypeScript migration of the multiple choice platform provides:

- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive interfaces for all data structures (Question, Test, Results, etc.)
- **Better Developer Experience**: IntelliSense, auto-completion, compile-time error checking
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear contracts between components with strong typing
- **Modern Tooling**: Dual build system supporting both browser and Node.js environments
- **Future-Proof**: Ready for advanced features with robust type definitions

## Vite Migration (October 2025)

The multiple choice platform was successfully migrated to use Vite as the build tool, providing significant development experience improvements:

### Migration Objectives

- Eliminate MIME type errors when serving TypeScript files directly
- Implement hot module replacement (HMR) for instant feedback during development
- Maintain the Express server on port 3001 for a consistent user experience
- Preserve the existing `npm run dev` workflow
- Optimize production builds with modern bundling

### Key Changes Implemented

#### 1. **Vite Integration**

- Added Vite 5.4.21 as the client build tool
- Configured `vite.config.ts` with proper root, build output (`dist/public`), and dev server settings
- Moved client code from `app.ts` to `src/main.ts` for Vite's convention
- Set up Vite to proxy `/api` requests back to Express during development

#### 2. **Development Architecture**

- **Dev Proxy Pattern**: Express server proxies non-API requests to Vite dev server
  - Express runs on port 3001 (user-facing)
  - Vite dev server runs on port 5173 (internal)
  - All `/api/*` requests handled by Express directly
  - All other requests (HTML, JS, CSS, assets) proxied to Vite for HMR
- **Dynamic Middleware**: `http-proxy-middleware` conditionally loaded in dev mode
- **Environment Detection**: Server detects `VITE_DEV=1` to enable proxy mode

#### 3. **Build System Enhancements**

- **Dual TypeScript Compilation**:
  - Client: `tsconfig.client.json` → ES2020 modules → processed by Vite
  - Server: `tsconfig.server.json` → CommonJS → `dist/server.js`
- **Production Build**: Two-step process
  1. `vite build` → produces optimized client bundle in `dist/public/`
  2. `tsc -p tsconfig.server.json` → compiles server to `dist/server.js`
- **Development Build**: Separate watch processes for client and server

#### 4. **Development Orchestration**

- Created `scripts/dev-runner.js` to manage the development workflow:
  - Spawns TypeScript watch compiler for server code
  - Spawns Vite dev server on port 5173 with HMR enabled
  - Waits for both to be ready before starting Express server
  - Monitors `dist/server.js` for changes and restarts server automatically
  - Uses polling instead of filesystem watchers to avoid EMFILE errors
  - Provides clear, emoji-enhanced logging for debugging

#### 5. **Backward Compatibility**

- `app.ts` serves as a compatibility shim exporting from `src/main.ts`
- `index.html` includes dynamic loader that:
  - Attempts to load from Vite dev server in development
  - Falls back to production build if Vite not available
  - Probes for correct MIME types to avoid browser blocking

#### 6. **File Watcher Optimization**

- Replaced `chokidar` with polling-based file monitoring
- Prevents EMFILE (too many open files) errors on Linux
- Uses `fs.statSync()` and `setInterval()` for change detection
- More reliable across different operating systems

### Migration Challenges Resolved

1. **MIME Type Error**: Browser blocking `.ts` files with `video/mp2t` content-type
   - **Solution**: Vite serves files with correct MIME types; Express proxies to Vite

2. **Port Management**: Keeping user-facing URL on port 3001
   - **Solution**: Express acts as gateway, proxying to Vite internally

3. **API Route Interception**: Proxy middleware catching `/api` requests
   - **Solution**: Registered API routes BEFORE proxy middleware in Express

4. **File Watcher Limits**: EMFILE errors from too many watchers
   - **Solution**: Switched to polling-based file monitoring in dev-runner

5. **Server Startup Coordination**: Starting server before Vite ready
   - **Solution**: Dev-runner probes Vite ports and waits for both conditions

### Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Instant HMR**: Sub-second updates when changing client code
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper module resolution
- ✅ **Optimized Builds**: Tree-shaking and code-splitting in production
- ✅ **Better DX**: Single `npm run dev` command starts everything
- ✅ **No Port Confusion**: Users always access localhost:3001
- ✅ **Reliable Workflow**: Polling-based watchers avoid system limits
- ✅ **Clean Separation**: Client and server code clearly delineated

### Updated npm Scripts

```json
{
  "dev": "node scripts/dev-runner.js",
  "build": "npm run build:server && npm run build:client",
  "build:server": "tsc -p tsconfig.server.json",
  "build:client": "vite build",
  "build:watch": "concurrently \"npm:build:server -- --watch\" \"npm:build:client -- --watch\"",
  "start": "node dist/server.js",
  "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
  "clean": "rm -rf dist"
}
```

### Files Added/Modified

**New Files:**

- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration
- `scripts/dev-runner.js` - Development orchestration
- `src/main.ts` - Client entry point (moved from `app.ts`)
- `tsconfig.client.json` - Client TypeScript config

**Modified Files:**

- `server.ts` - Added dev proxy middleware
- `package.json` - Updated scripts and dependencies
- `index.html` - Added dynamic loader for dev/prod compatibility
- `app.ts` - Now a compatibility shim

**Dependencies Added:**

- `vite@^5.4.21` - Build tool
- `http-proxy-middleware@^2.0.6` - Dev proxy

### Production Deployment Notes

- Run `npm run build` to create optimized bundles
- `dist/public/` contains client assets (served as static files)
- `dist/server.js` is the compiled Express server
- Server automatically serves from `dist/public/` when not in dev mode
- No Vite runtime needed in production

This context should be referenced for all future development to ensure consistency and proper continuation of the project.
