## Application 2: Vite + TypeScript Multiple Choice Platform (multiple_choice)

### Description
A unified assessment platform built with **Vite and TypeScript** that dynamically loads different multiple choice tests from modular resource files. This consolidates all multiple choice functionality into a single scalable application with comprehensive type safety, modern build tooling, hot module replacement (HMR), and an optimized development workflow. Tests are stored as data files rather than separate applications.

### Key Features
- **Modern Build System**: Vite for fast HMR and optimized production builds
- **Development Proxy Architecture**: Express server proxies to Vite in dev mode for seamless development
- **Dynamic test loading** from modular resource files
- **Question grid navigation** with visual progress indicators for jumping to specific questions
- **Test selection interface** with difficulty levels and topic descriptions
- **API-driven architecture** for loading test metadata and content
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile
- **Unified timer system** with visual warnings
- **Comprehensive results** with detailed explanations and topic breakdown
- **Scalable structure** for easy addition of new tests
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Instant updates during development without full page reloads

### Architecture Overview

#### Development Mode
```
npm run dev
  ↓
dev-runner.js orchestrates:
  1. tsc --watch (server: tsconfig.server.json → dist/server.js)
  2. vite dev server (client: port 5173 with HMR)
  3. node dist/server.js (Express on port 3001)
     ↓
Express proxies non-/api requests → Vite (port 5173)
API routes handled by Express directly
Browser accesses: http://localhost:3001
```

#### Production Build
```
npm run build
  ↓
1. tsc -p tsconfig.server.json → dist/server.js (CommonJS)
2. vite build → dist/public/ (optimized client bundle)
  ↓
npm start
  ↓
Express serves static files from dist/public/
Browser accesses: http://localhost:3001
```

### Technical Implementation
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.x for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript on port 3001
- **Client**: TypeScript (ES2020 modules) compiled via Vite
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server on port 5173 (proxied through Express)
- **Dev Orchestration**: Custom script (`scripts/dev-runner.js`) manages:
  - TypeScript watch compilation for server
  - Vite dev server with HMR
  - Express server with dynamic proxy
  - Automatic restarts on server code changes
- **Proxy Middleware**: `http-proxy-middleware` for dev mode routing
- **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive interfaces for all data structures
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/tests` - List all available tests by difficulty
  - `GET /api/test/:difficulty/:testId` - Load specific test data
- **Test Format**: Node.js modules exporting typed metadata and questions
- **Dynamic Loading**: Type-safe tests loaded on-demand via fetch API calls
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to add new tests without code changes

### Development Workflow Improvements
- **Fast HMR**: Vite provides instant hot module replacement for client code
- **Automatic Restarts**: Server restarts automatically when TypeScript server code changes
- **Single Command**: `npm run dev` starts everything with one command
- **Port Management**: Browser URL stays on port 3001; Vite runs internally on 5173
- **No MIME Errors**: Proper proxying ensures correct content types for all resources
- **Polling-based File Watching**: Avoids system file watcher limits (EMFILE errors)

  - Dual build system (client: Vite bundle, server: CommonJS)
  - Type-safe interfaces for all data structures
  - Custom dev orchestration with automatic restarts
  - Production-ready with optimized builds
- ❌ easy_multiple_choice_1, easy_multiple_choice_2, easy_multiple_choice_3 - Removed (replaced by consolidated Vite+TypeScript platform)
- 🔄 Ready for additional assessment development
- 📦 Both remaining applications have dependencies installed and are functional

## User Intentions

The user plans to:
1. Continue building more assessment applications
2. Create a comprehensive suite of programming interview preparation tools
3. Maintain consistency across all assessment applications

## TypeScript Migration Benefits (multiple_choice)

The TypeScript migration of the multiple choice platform provides:

- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive interfaces for all data structures (Question, Test, Results, etc.)
- **Better Developer Experience**: IntelliSense, auto-completion, compile-time error checking
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear contracts between components with strong typing
- **Modern Tooling**: Dual build system supporting both browser and Node.js environments
- **Future-Proof**: Ready for advanced features with robust type definitions

## Vite Migration (October 2025)

The multiple choice platform was successfully migrated to use Vite as the build tool, providing significant development experience improvements:

### Migration Objectives

- Eliminate MIME type errors when serving TypeScript files directly
- Implement hot module replacement (HMR) for instant feedback during development
- Maintain the Express server on port 3001 for a consistent user experience
- Preserve the existing `npm run dev` workflow
- Optimize production builds with modern bundling

### Key Changes Implemented

#### 1. **Vite Integration**

- Added Vite 5.4.21 as the client build tool
- Configured `vite.config.ts` with proper root, build output (`dist/public`), and dev server settings
- Moved client code from `app.ts` to `src/main.ts` for Vite's convention
- Set up Vite to proxy `/api` requests back to Express during development

#### 2. **Development Architecture**

- **Dev Proxy Pattern**: Express server proxies non-API requests to Vite dev server
  - Express runs on port 3001 (user-facing)
  - Vite dev server runs on port 5173 (internal)
  - All `/api/*` requests handled by Express directly
  - All other requests (HTML, JS, CSS, assets) proxied to Vite for HMR
- **Dynamic Middleware**: `http-proxy-middleware` conditionally loaded in dev mode
- **Environment Detection**: Server detects `VITE_DEV=1` to enable proxy mode

#### 3. **Build System Enhancements**

- **Dual TypeScript Compilation**:
  - Client: `tsconfig.client.json` → ES2020 modules → processed by Vite
  - Server: `tsconfig.server.json` → CommonJS → `dist/server.js`
- **Production Build**: Two-step process
  1. `vite build` → produces optimized client bundle in `dist/public/`
  2. `tsc -p tsconfig.server.json` → compiles server to `dist/server.js`
- **Development Build**: Separate watch processes for client and server

#### 4. **Development Orchestration**

- Created `scripts/dev-runner.js` to manage the development workflow:
  - Spawns TypeScript watch compiler for server code
  - Spawns Vite dev server on port 5173 with HMR enabled
  - Waits for both to be ready before starting Express server
  - Monitors `dist/server.js` for changes and restarts server automatically
  - Uses polling instead of filesystem watchers to avoid EMFILE errors
  - Provides clear, emoji-enhanced logging for debugging

#### 5. **Backward Compatibility**

- `app.ts` serves as a compatibility shim exporting from `src/main.ts`
- `index.html` includes dynamic loader that:
  - Attempts to load from Vite dev server in development
  - Falls back to production build if Vite not available
  - Probes for correct MIME types to avoid browser blocking

#### 6. **File Watcher Optimization**

- Replaced `chokidar` with polling-based file monitoring
- Prevents EMFILE (too many open files) errors on Linux
- Uses `fs.statSync()` and `setInterval()` for change detection
- More reliable across different operating systems

### Migration Challenges Resolved

1. **MIME Type Error**: Browser blocking `.ts` files with `video/mp2t` content-type
   - **Solution**: Vite serves files with correct MIME types; Express proxies to Vite

2. **Port Management**: Keeping user-facing URL on port 3001
   - **Solution**: Express acts as gateway, proxying to Vite internally

3. **API Route Interception**: Proxy middleware catching `/api` requests
   - **Solution**: Registered API routes BEFORE proxy middleware in Express

4. **File Watcher Limits**: EMFILE errors from too many watchers
   - **Solution**: Switched to polling-based file monitoring in dev-runner

5. **Server Startup Coordination**: Starting server before Vite ready
   - **Solution**: Dev-runner probes Vite ports and waits for both conditions

### Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Instant HMR**: Sub-second updates when changing client code
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper module resolution
- ✅ **Optimized Builds**: Tree-shaking and code-splitting in production
- ✅ **Better DX**: Single `npm run dev` command starts everything
- ✅ **No Port Confusion**: Users always access localhost:3001
- ✅ **Reliable Workflow**: Polling-based watchers avoid system limits
- ✅ **Clean Separation**: Client and server code clearly delineated

### Updated npm Scripts

```json
{
  "dev": "node scripts/dev-runner.js",
  "build": "npm run build:server && npm run build:client",
  "build:server": "tsc -p tsconfig.server.json",
  "build:client": "vite build",
  "build:watch": "concurrently \"npm:build:server -- --watch\" \"npm:build:client -- --watch\"",
  "start": "node dist/server.js",
  "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
  "clean": "rm -rf dist"
}
```

### Files Added/Modified

**New Files:**

- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration
- `scripts/dev-runner.js` - Development orchestration
- `src/main.ts` - Client entry point (moved from `app.ts`)
- `tsconfig.client.json` - Client TypeScript config

**Modified Files:**

- `server.ts` - Added dev proxy middleware
- `package.json` - Updated scripts and dependencies
- `index.html` - Added dynamic loader for dev/prod compatibility
- `app.ts` - Now a compatibility shim

**Dependencies Added:**

- `vite@^5.4.21` - Build tool
- `http-proxy-middleware@^2.0.6` - Dev proxy

### Production Deployment Notes

- Run `npm run build` to create optimized bundles
- `dist/public/` contains client assets (served as static files)
- `dist/server.js` is the compiled Express server
- Server automatically serves from `dist/public/` when not in dev mode
- No Vite runtime needed in production

## Code Quality & Testing (October 2025)

### Refactoring Initiative

Following the Vite migration, a comprehensive code refactoring was performed to improve maintainability, testability, and code organization in the multiple_choice platform.

#### 1. **TypeScript Models Centralization**

**Goal**: Consolidate all TypeScript interfaces and types into a dedicated models directory.

**Changes**:
- Created `src/models/` directory with modular type definition files:
  - `question.ts` - Question and option types
  - `assessment.ts` - Test/assessment metadata types
  - `results.ts` - Results and scoring types
  - `format.ts` - Formatting configuration types
  - `index.ts` - Re-exports all types for convenient imports

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for all type definitions
- Easy to locate and update interfaces
- Better code organization and discoverability
- Type-only imports used in `src/main.ts` for optimal bundling

#### 2. **Utility Functions Extraction**

**Goal**: Remove helper functions from `src/main.ts` and organize them into focused utility modules.

**Changes**:
- Created `src/utils/` directory with three utility modules:
  - **`formatUtils.ts`**: Text and code formatting functions
    - `escapeHtml()` - HTML entity escaping
    - `formatWithMarkers()` - [CODE] marker-based formatting
    - `formatAutoDetect()` - Automatic code detection and formatting
    - `formatTextWithCode()` - Unified formatting entry point
  - **`dateUtils.ts`**: Date formatting utilities
    - `formatDate()` - Locale-aware date/time formatting with fallback
  - **`resultsUtils.ts`**: Results calculation helpers
    - `getScoreBadgeClass()` - Score classification (excellent/good/average/poor)
    - `getImprovementTopics()` - Identify weak topic areas
    - `formatTimeTaken()` - Convert duration to MM:SS format

**Benefits**:
- `src/main.ts` reduced from ~750 lines with clearer responsibilities
- Utilities are reusable across the application
- Each module has a single, well-defined purpose
- Easier to test individual functions in isolation

#### 3. **Comprehensive Unit Testing**

**Goal**: Achieve high code coverage with automated tests for all utility functions.

**Test Framework Setup**:
- **Vitest 4.0.3** - Modern, fast test runner compatible with Vite
- **@vitest/coverage-v8** - Built-in V8-based coverage reporting
- **jsdom** - DOM environment for browser API testing
- Configuration in `vitest.config.ts`:
  ```typescript
  {

**Testing Approach - Deterministic Tests**:
- **Challenge**: Date/time behavior varies by timezone and locale
- **Solution**: Temporarily stub Date prototype methods during tests
  - Mock `toLocaleDateString()` and `toLocaleTimeString()` to force exceptions
  - Stub date getters (`getHours`, `getMinutes`, etc.) to return fixed values
  - Restore original methods in `finally` blocks to prevent test pollution
- **Alternative**: Dependency injection (recommended for future refactoring)
  - Refactor functions to accept injectable clock/formatter dependencies
  - Pass fake implementations in tests instead of stubbing globals
  - Cleaner, safer, and more maintainable approach

**npm Scripts for Testing**:
```json
{
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage",
  "type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
}
```

**Running Tests**:
```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
npm test

# Run tests once
npm test -- --run

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Type-check without running tests
npm run type-check
```

**Coverage Reports**:
- Text summary printed to console
- HTML report generated in `coverage/index.html`
- Open `coverage/index.html` in browser for interactive exploration

#### 4. **Dependency Management**

**Version Alignment**:
- Updated Vitest and coverage provider to latest stable versions
- Resolved peer dependency conflicts with Express types
- Current critical dependencies:
  ```json
  {
    "devDependencies": {
      "@types/express": "^4.17.21",
      "@vitest/coverage-v8": "^4.0.3",
      "vitest": "^4.0.3",
      "jsdom": "^22.1.0"
    }
  }
  ```

**Installation Notes**:
- Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag during development to resolve conflicts
- Final stable configuration works without flags
- Clean install: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`

### Code Quality Metrics

**Before Refactoring**:
- Single `src/main.ts` file with ~750 lines
- Inline type definitions mixed with logic
- Helper functions embedded in main class
- No unit tests or coverage measurement

**After Refactoring**:
- `src/main.ts` focused on UI logic and orchestration
- Types organized in `src/models/` (5 files)
- Utilities extracted to `src/utils/` (3 files)
- Comprehensive test suite (13 tests, 100% pass rate)
- 98.5% statement coverage, 92.5% branch coverage
- All utility functions have 100% line coverage

### Future Improvements

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. **Dependency Injection Refactor**: Remove Date prototype stubbing
   - Refactor `formatDate` to accept optional clock/formatter parameters
   - Update tests to pass fake implementations instead of stubbing
   
2. **Increase Branch Coverage for formatUtils**: Currently 85.71%
   - Add tests for edge cases in markup parsing
   - Test different code block patterns and escape sequences
   
3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow
   - Run tests and coverage on every PR
   - Enforce minimum coverage thresholds
   - Publish coverage reports to GitHub Pages or Codecov

4. **Test Main Application Logic**:
   - Create tests for `AssessmentApp` class in `src/main.ts`
   - Mock DOM elements and browser APIs
   - Test state management and user interactions

### Benefits of Testing & Refactoring

- **Confidence**: Changes can be made safely with test coverage
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living examples of how functions work
- **Regression Prevention**: Automated tests catch bugs early
- **Code Quality**: Refactoring improved modularity and maintainability
- **Developer Experience**: Fast test feedback loop with Vitest's HMR
- **Onboarding**: New developers can understand code structure quickly

This context should be referenced for all future development to ensure consistency and proper continuation of the project.
